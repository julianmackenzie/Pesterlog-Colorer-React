### Blog
This project was created across two and a half weeks as part of a summer CS internship between other tasks. I hope it is of good use to lots of people!
As this gets updated, this window will hold previous version information as well as the latest updates that I make, and potentially some sort of blog area since I've always enjoyed documenting the fun and miserable parts of my projects.
