### Blog
Funnily enough, due to the nature of this addition, I'm writing this changelog long before the update was ready.
I need to test importing changelogs from markdown files, so instead of a placeholder I'm writing up this future changelog!\
I wanted to get this project out to the public, and I was holding it hostage by forcing myself to future-proof when it didn't necessarily need it by overcomplicating the changelog menu. I'll work on this feature behind the scenes, but for now, a simple scroll list of the three changelogs I have will suffice.
