# gentleTranscendent's Pesterlog Colorer
This program is for use on https://mspfa.com for quickly and effectively adding BBCode color tags to Pesterlogs. If none of that makes any sense to you, you probably haven't read Homestuck, which you can do at https://www.homestuck.com. Additionally, you can read the comic that inspired the creation of this tool, my own VirtualVexed (https://mspfa.com/?s=48400&p=1).

The program, written in JavaScript with React, contains a full tutorial on its use.
