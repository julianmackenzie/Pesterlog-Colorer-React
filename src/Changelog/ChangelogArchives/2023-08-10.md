### Summary

Added
- Fully implemented Version menu for viewing past changelogs
- Added a lot to the backend to handle parsing a changelog file out into html elements

### Blog
Funnily enough, due to the nature of this addition, I had to write this changelog long before the update was ready.
I need to test importing into different version submenus, so instead of a placeholder I'm writing up this future changelog!
